# JavaScript Logic and Conditional Exercises

This repository contains a collection of seven sequential scripts written in vanilla JavaScript, designed to provide practice with fundamental programming logic and control flow. The project is intended for beginners learning how to use conditional statements (`if...else`, `switch`) to solve a variety of small problems.

All interaction with these scripts is handled through the web browser's `prompt` for user input and the developer `console` for output.

## About The Project

This educational project provides hands-on practice with the core building blocks of decision-making in code. Each of the seven scripts presents a unique problem that requires the use of conditional logic to produce the correct result. The project is self-contained and requires no external libraries or complex setup.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   **Conditional Statements**: Extensive use of `if...else if...else` and `switch` statements to control program flow.
*   **Logical Operators**: Using operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!==` (not equal to) to build complex conditions.
*   **User Input and Type Conversion**: Getting user data with `prompt()` and converting it to numbers with `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()`.
*   **String Manipulation**: Accessing characters by index, checking length, and using methods like `.split()`, `.reverse()`, and `.join()` to solve problems like palindrome checking.
*   **The Modulo Operator (`%`)**: A key tool used in the leap year calculation.
*   **Console Output**: Displaying results to the user in the developer console using template literals.

## Included Exercises

The `app.js` file contains the following seven sequential exercises:

1.  **Age Classifier**: Determines if a person is a child, teenager, adult, or pensioner based on their age.
2.  **Number-to-Symbol Converter**: Maps a number from 0-9 to a specific special character (e.g., 1 -> '!', 2 -> '@').
3.  **Duplicate Digit Checker**: Checks if any digits are repeated in a three-digit number.
4.  **Leap Year Calculator**: Determines if a given year is a leap year according to the standard rules.
5.  **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a five-digit number reads the same forwards and backwards.
6.  **Multi-Currency Converter**: Converts a USD amount into one of three chosen currencies (EUR, UAN, AZN).
7.  **Discount Calculator**: Applies a discount to a purchase amount based on a tiered system (e.g., more spent means a higher discount).

## How to Run the Project

This project runs entirely in your web browser; there is no visible content on the webpage itself.

1.  **Download the Files**:
    *   Clone or download the repository containing `index.html` and `app.js`.

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    *   Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
    *   The page will appear blank. This is the correct behavior.

3.  **Open the Developer Console**:
    *   Press the `F12` key on your keyboard.
    *   Alternatively, right-click on the blank page, select "Inspect", and navigate to the **"Console"** tab.

4.  **Follow the Prompts**:
    *   The first script will run automatically, and a pop-up `prompt` box will appear, asking for your input.
    *   After you enter a value and click "OK", the next prompt for the following exercise will appear. This will continue for all seven exercises.

5.  **See the Results**:
    *   The result of each exercise will be printed to the developer console after you provide the necessary input. Keep the console open to see all the output.
